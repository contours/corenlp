  6: [me] People call me Art .
  7: [I] Some people , I guess , by virtue of the honorific call me Judge .
  7: [me] Some people , I guess , by virtue of the honorific call me Judge .
 10: [I] I was born before World War II , right as it started .
 11: [I] I remember very well my dad was a PT boat skipper in the South Pacific during World War II .
 11: [my] I remember very well my dad was a PT boat skipper in the South Pacific during World War II .
 12: [I] I remember those days well .
 14: [my] He and my mother were good card players and supplemented the GI Bill by playing cards at night .
 16: [me] He would leave her sleeping in the morning and take me to law school .
 17: [I] It was n't long after that that I went to law school so I remembered that very well .
 18: [My] My grand daddy was the only general evangelist the North Alabama Methodists ever had .
 20: [I] I was raised here during the war with my dad 's five sisters and my mother 's mother and daddy .
 20: [my] I was raised here during the war with my dad 's five sisters and my mother 's mother and daddy .
 21: [I] I was basically raised by my aunts and my grandmother during those years .
 21: [my] I was basically raised by my aunts and my grandmother during those years .
 22: [I] Thereafter I traveled with my family .
 22: [my] Thereafter I traveled with my family .
 23: [I] I was raised in Birmingham , but we lived in Chicago and Washington , D. C. when my dad was in the FBI .
 23: [my] I was raised in Birmingham , but we lived in Chicago and Washington , D. C. when my dad was in the FBI .
 24: [I] Then we came back and I went to Woodlawn High School here , and from there went to Princeton .
 25: [I] I played football here , a very , very fine football school .
 26: [I] I supposed I was the worst athlete that every started at Woodlawn High School , but everybody got scholarships .
 26: [the worst athlete that every started at Woodlawn High School] I supposed I was the worst athlete that every started at Woodlawn High School , but everybody got scholarships .
 27: [I] Mine , of course , were to places like Sewanee and Ripon College , and I was invited to walk on at Vanderbilt .
 27: [Mine] Mine , of course , were to places like Sewanee and Ripon College , and I was invited to walk on at Vanderbilt .
 28: [I] I wanted to play for the new coach at Alabama .
 29: [I] Coach Paul Bryant had been there a couple of years and had a couple of my teammates with him , so I went down to talk with him about going to Alabama .
 29: [my] Coach Paul Bryant had been there a couple of years and had a couple of my teammates with him , so I went down to talk with him about going to Alabama .
 30: [me] He said , `` Artie , you can walk on here , but you 're too little to play for me .
 31: [I] I think you ought to take that brain and go up to that Ivy League and play some of that sissy ball . ''
 32: [I] It was the best advice I ever got from a man not my father .
 32: [my] It was the best advice I ever got from a man not my father .
 33: [I] So that 's how I wound up at Princeton .
 34: [I] I came back to Alabama to law school .
 38: [I] In 1965 I was in law school , and my dad had left the office of mayor of Birmingham and not run for a second term .
 38: [my] In 1965 I was in law school , and my dad had left the office of mayor of Birmingham and not run for a second term .
 41: [I] I was in a position to have some of those pretty good jobs at the big law firms .
 42: [I] We discussed whether we were going to be trial lawyers or whether we were going to go for the secure silk stocking life , and we decided to partner up when I finished law school , and take cases , and try cases together .
 43: [me] So my law professor let me off for two weeks in the fall of '65 to try Collin Leroy Wilkins down in Hayneville with my father , and he was acquitted .
 43: [my] So my law professor let me off for two weeks in the fall of '65 to try Collin Leroy Wilkins down in Hayneville with my father , and he was acquitted .
 48: [I] My dad and I went to London .
 48: [My] My dad and I went to London .
 50: [I] As we speak now I 'm the only person alive who ever prepared the Martin Luther King case for trial , and it was our turn of events .
 52: [I] I had spent all day Friday with him in Memphis .
 54: [I] I came back to Birmingham to get my dad and our files .
 54: [my] I came back to Birmingham to get my dad and our files .
 57: [I] By Thursday he was calling saying , `` I made the worst mistake I ever made in my life .
 57: [my] By Thursday he was calling saying , `` I made the worst mistake I ever made in my life .
 58: [me] All this guy wants me to do is plead guilty .
 59: [me] Please come back and try this case for me . ''
 61: [I] He got in there right after I left on Friday .
 64: [I] A sidelight , not what you 're here for , but I 'm reasonably convinced James Earl Ray did not fire the shot the killed Dr. King .
 65: [I] I think I could convince you of it if I had about thirty minutes to do so .
 69: [I] Pop and I agreed that we were going to be courageous lawyers , that we would undertake unpopular causes for reasonable fees of course .
 83: [I] By then I was sitting in the front chair , and my dad was slowing down some .
 83: [my] By then I was sitting in the front chair , and my dad was slowing down some .
107: [me] In fact , Dynamite Bob led me into being judge .
108: [I] I 'll tell you how .
109: [I] Just like in the Ray case I try not to be a conspiracy nut .
110: [I] In fact , I try not to be any kind of nut at all .
111: [I] In the Chambliss case I try not to be spooky or eerie , but let me just tell you an experience I had .
111: [me] In the Chambliss case I try not to be spooky or eerie , but let me just tell you an experience I had .
116: [Hanes] It came the moment , and the judge looked down and said , `` Mr. Hanes , your first witness . ''
116: [Mr. Hanes] It came the moment , and the judge looked down and said , `` Mr. Hanes , your first witness . ''
116: [Mr. Hanes , your first witness] It came the moment , and the judge looked down and said , `` Mr. Hanes , your first witness . ''
116: [your first witness] It came the moment , and the judge looked down and said , `` Mr. Hanes , your first witness . ''
117: [I] I stood up , and I looked down at Bob Chambliss , and said , `` Take the stand Bob . ''
118: [I] I 'll never forget it .
119: [me] He looked up at me and said , `` No . ''
120: [I] I said , `` Bob ! You did n't understand me .
120: [me] I said , `` Bob ! You did n't understand me .
123: [I] He said , `` I 'm not going . ''
124: [I] Willoughby , I try not to be , and I know that in retrospect it 's not as I remember it , but from this vantage point I swear his face shimmered with evil as I looked at it .
125: [I] It was at that moment that I knew to a certainty he was the vilest , most evil , guiltiest son of a gun I had ever touched or represented .
126: [I] Somewhere deep inside me , when he was looking up at me and said , `` I 'm not going , '' -- we were in front of the entire world -- I knew right that moment I was n't going spend the rest of my life defending and cashing myself , and bleeding my heart out for people like this any more .
126: [me] Somewhere deep inside me , when he was looking up at me and said , `` I 'm not going , '' -- we were in front of the entire world -- I knew right that moment I was n't going spend the rest of my life defending and cashing myself , and bleeding my heart out for people like this any more .

126: [myself] Somewhere deep inside me , when he was looking up at me and said , `` I 'm not going , '' -- we were in front of the entire world -- I knew right that moment I was n't going spend the rest of my life defending and cashing myself , and bleeding my heart out for people like this any more .
130: [I] I did the absolute , dead level best I could to prevent it , but I 'm telling you that was as just a verdict as there ever was in the whole history of the world .
133: [I] Then the opportunity came , and I became a circuit judge here .
134: [I] We are divided into divisions , and I spent the next nearly twenty years trying nothing but civil cases which I had done a good bit of as a lawyer also .
135: [I] I 've enjoyed writing and serving on committees .
136: [I] I 'm chairman of our pattern jury instructions committee .
136: [chairman of our pattern jury instructions committee] I 'm chairman of our pattern jury instructions committee .
137: [I] I helped write the rules of evidence .
138: [I] I wrote a domestic relations book .
140: [I] I guess that 's a nutshell rendition .
149: [I] The truth of the matter is she did n't prove a thing , I did n't think .
160: [I] I believe he remembered everything that he did that night , but the real truth of it , the real truth of it is that it 's harder on the state than the defendant .
163: [I] So in general terms I would guess that the popular line would be that , `` Oh that 's a horrible disadvantage to the defendant . ''
172: [My] My gracious , the Liuzzo case had the attorney general of the United States down here .
179: [I] That was the first of the times , totally undeserved nonetheless true , Birmingham had been pilloried in the media of the world , and there was this collective societal desire to purge ourselves of this demon , so I think it probably was well received at the time .
184: [I] I 'll say this about Blanton and Cherry .
186: [I] I commend them for that .
188: [I] I do , but my friend Judge Jim Garrett was on the bench at the same time I was and , frankly , we discussed those at the time , not necessarily because I knew anything about the case but because I was one of the authors of our rules of evidence .
188: [my] I do , but my friend Judge Jim Garrett was on the bench at the same time I was and , frankly , we discussed those at the time , not necessarily because I knew anything about the case but because I was one of the authors of our rules of evidence .
209: [I] I 've always -- I 'd say not always -- I have said that Bob Chambliss was the most evil person I ever met or dealt with .
210: [I] I turned down an unpopular case just because of the -- I wo n't tell you what we talked about or what he said -- but Byron De La Beckwith asked me to represent him at one time in the Medger Evers case , and I just could n't do it .
210: [me] I turned down an unpopular case just because of the -- I wo n't tell you what we talked about or what he said -- but Byron De La Beckwith asked me to represent him at one time in the Medger Evers case , and I just could n't do it .
211: [I] I 'm sorry .
212: [I] I prided myself on being a lawyer , a lawyer without personal -- that 's another story .
212: [myself] I prided myself on being a lawyer , a lawyer without personal -- that 's another story .
217: [me] Would you like to hear that story from me ?
221: [I] They came in with the conviction , and I and Judge Mike Bolen who is our probate judge here was a partner , sat at the table , my brother Tom , and my dad and I conferred after the immediate flurry after the verdict came down .
221: [a partner] They came in with the conviction , and I and Judge Mike Bolen who is our probate judge here was a partner , sat at the table , my brother Tom , and my dad and I conferred after the immediate flurry after the verdict came down .
221: [my] They came in with the conviction , and I and Judge Mike Bolen who is our probate judge here was a partner , sat at the table , my brother Tom , and my dad and I conferred after the immediate flurry after the verdict came down .
224: [I] I told my partners , `` Fellows , I 'll take the rap .
224: [my] I told my partners , `` Fellows , I 'll take the rap .
225: [I] I sat in the front chair .
226: [I] I made the arguments .
227: [I] I 'll go tell Miss Tee , '' because we all loved her as much as we despised Bob .
228: [I] So I went to their house in North Birmingham .
232: [I] I went the front door , and it was one of those clear , rare , low humidity Birmingham days , in the 70s maybe .
233: [I] The front door was open , but the screen was shut , and I could see it was dark inside .
234: [I] I rapped on the screen .
235: [I] I could hear this faint little voice , `` Who is it ? '' I said , `` Miss Tee , it 's Art . ''
237: [I] And I opened the screen , and I stepped into their little living room .
239: [I] She was lying there on the sofa and , I do n't know , maybe I read too much great literature at Princeton , but I had these pictures in my mind .
239: [my] She was lying there on the sofa and , I do n't know , maybe I read too much great literature at Princeton , but I had these pictures in my mind .
240: [I] I could see the dust motes floating through the slanting rays of sunlight , the few that were filtering into the room .
246: [I] I scootched my way onto a little edge of the sofa where she was lying , and I said , `` Miss Tee , . I 've got bad news for you . ''
246: [my] I scootched my way onto a little edge of the sofa where she was lying , and I said , `` Miss Tee , . I 've got bad news for you . ''
247: [I] She said , `` What is it ? '' I said , `` Miss Tee , they convicted Bob . ''
248: [I] She said , `` They convicted Bob ? '' And I said , `` Yes , mam . ''
249: [I] She said , `` When will he be coming home ? '' I said , `` Miss Tee , he wo n't be coming home . ''
250: [I] She pulled the rag off her head , and she said , `` He wo n't be corning home ? '' And I said , `` No , mam '' She said , `` Do you promise me ? '' I said , `` Yes , mam . ''
250: [me] She pulled the rag off her head , and she said , `` He wo n't be corning home ? '' And I said , `` No , mam '' She said , `` Do you promise me ? '' I said , `` Yes , mam . ''
253: [I] I knew at that moment , I knew at that very moment that my instinct was right , that he was an evil , guilty , son of a gun . ''
253: [my] I knew at that moment , I knew at that very moment that my instinct was right , that he was an evil , guilty , son of a gun . ''
258: [I] He was n't there , but Bill Baxley can tell a story , I can assure you .
262: [I] I do n't know .
264: [I] Bill would probably have a better idea than I do .
272: [I] I would think in part the lack of access to FBI information .
274: [I] I think even Doug Jones had difficulty getting all of it from the federal government .
277: [I] I would think that in those days there would have been a lot of debate about the advantages and disadvantages .
279: [I] I mean the University of Alabama was n't even integrated in 1963 .
283: [I] I do n't know .
284: [I] I 'm just speculating .
285: [I] I can think of a lot of reasons why .
286: [I] I would think there would probably have been fear on the part of the witnesses to come forward .
287: [I] As I understand it there is evidence that is very compelling against all these defendants that to this good day has n't been put on simply due to , even to this day , the reluctance and the fear of witnesses to testify .
289: [I] I would defer to Bill Baxley 's assessment of it as opposed to mine , but I can think from scratch of a lot of good reasons why it would n't have been prosecuted then .
294: [I] As a young lawyer I used to go by and talk to him .
300: [I] Judge Gibson told me one time , I guess it was after that trial but before I became judge .
300: [me] Judge Gibson told me one time , I guess it was after that trial but before I became judge .
301: [I] I went by his office and was visiting with him .
304: [me] Let me tell you something .
305: [I] They say that I 'm mean , and I guess that I am , but I want you to know I did n't start out to be mean .
306: [I] I started out to be nice .
307: [I] I started out to be everybody 's friend , but lawyers will make you mean .
309: [I] You 've got to get your wisdom where you find it , and that was a piece of wisdom that I took to heart .
317: [I] I do n't know if you 've ever been in that big ceremonial courtroom ?
321: [I] I think that it made the movie where I pointed out that jury box to Spike Lee , but behind it there was a wall , and that wall was just matted with microphones from all over the world , news people hanging them down to record the proceedings which was just radical for the day that that would be allowed .
324: [I] I mean , bear in mind , I had three great grand daddies rode off from this valley before Birmingham was a city .
325: [My] My grand daddy was a preacher .
326: [I] I had five aunts who were prominent school principals .
328: [My] My daddy was president of the Birmingham Board of Education for ten years .
331: [I] He and I were active trial lawyers here , and I spent twenty years as circuit judge .
332: [I] So , in answer to your questions , `` Did I know anybody in Operation New Birmingham ? '' yeah , I did .
336: [I] I 've known everybody in town , if that 's possible in a city this size , my whole life .
336: [my] I 've known everybody in town , if that 's possible in a city this size , my whole life .
338: [I] I do n't know where you 're leading me to .
338: [me] I do n't know where you 're leading me to .
339: [I] I 'm sorry .
341: [I] I lived through those days .
342: [I] I knew Al Lingo when Al Lingo -- I guess you 've run across his name ?
346: [I] I went over there .
347: [I] I argued to the state supreme court when I was a second year law student before they even had third year cards .
347: [a second year law student] I argued to the state supreme court when I was a second year law student before they even had third year cards .
349: [I] I would carry messages .
350: [I] I guess I was twenty-one .
351: [I] I was in college , but I would carry messages for Governor Wallace or my dad , whatever it was .
351: [my] I was in college , but I would carry messages for Governor Wallace or my dad , whatever it was .
352: [I] I remember going in and Colonel Lingo always looked like he stepped out of a band box .
358: [I] I do n't know , when ? You 're the historian .
359: [I] You would probably know better than I. Maybe 1962 , I guess , possibly 61 , 62 , 63 -- those years .
366: [I] I say poor old Bull Connor , poor old my daddy ! Pop used to just agonize .
366: [my] I say poor old Bull Connor , poor old my daddy ! Pop used to just agonize .
372: [My] My dad and Jack Kennedy had a real affinity for each other .
376: [I] I guess it was 1961 or 62 .
377: [My] My dad was still mayor .
380: [my] But my dad just agonized .
384: [I] I think Bill Hartsfield was mayor of Atlanta then .
388: [My] My dad was so agonized over it , and he was also so very worried about the potential for violence in Birmingham .
390: [I] I do n't know if it was the summer of '61 or ' 62 , but he asked the president if they could make peace , and he suggested that this summer to integrate the golf courses .
392: [I] I 'm talking about integration .
395: [My] My dad proposed to take the golf courses , the adult facilities , integrate those that summer , and then the adults would realize that it was n't the end of the world , that life would go on , and then the next summer he could give the swimming pools .
399: [I] I guess that was the Civil Rights Act of 62 maybe , or 63 .
407: [I] We 're talking about my daddy who , I guess , history has on the wrong side , if you will , of that issue .
407: [my] We 're talking about my daddy who , I guess , history has on the wrong side , if you will , of that issue .
408: [My] My daddy is the one who spent all of his money , sent me past thirteen confederate states of segregated colleges to go to integrated Princeton University .
408: [me] My daddy is the one who spent all of his money , sent me past thirteen confederate states of segregated colleges to go to integrated Princeton University .
413: [I] I 'm sure you 've read it .
415: [I] I 'm sure you 've read it .
418: [My] My dad has a son .
419: [I] I 'm not much , but I speak English , and I have some recollection of historical facts , and that is true across the boards .
420: [I] She pillories , as I understand it , Mr. Smyer who , in those days , was on the wrong side of the issue .
442: [I] I 'm not making that analogy more than it is , but that 's the kind of dramatic change , a massive societal change is what you were dealing with .
447: [my] Of course , my view of all of that is that you 're talking maybe within a generation , and that was a radical change , and it is a radical change .
448: [me] It seems to me that as long as people are making a living and gaining attention on the issue that it will remain an issue .
452: [me] Until we get to the point where the leadership , where the people my age are gone , segregation to me was n't part of my life really .
452: [my] Until we get to the point where the leadership , where the people my age are gone , segregation to me was n't part of my life really .
453: [my] What they call the `` N '' word now as never allowed in my house , for instance .
456: [I] But other than that , I just went about my business .
456: [my] But other than that , I just went about my business .
457: [I] I just did n't think about it .
458: [my] It just was n't part of my life .
459: [I] I think , however , if I were my age and I had been segregated until I was twenty-two years old I doubt that I would forget it .
459: [my] I think , however , if I were my age and I had been segregated until I was twenty-two years old I doubt that I would forget it .
460: [I] I have a lot of friends who were segregated for their lifetime , and they have a lot of equanimity , but it 's a different memory .
462: [I] I think we 've got to have the generations who remember living in a segregated society in the South for it to pass into history completely is my opinion of it .
462: [my] I think we 've got to have the generations who remember living in a segregated society in the South for it to pass into history completely is my opinion of it .
464: [I] I 've forgotten what you asked .
467: [me] You did n't start me off .
469: [I] You asked me if I knew anybody .
469: [me] You asked me if I knew anybody .
473: [I] He tried desperately to get me to go to Virginia when I started college .
473: [me] He tried desperately to get me to go to Virginia when I started college .
474: [I] I loved him , and he was active , gosh , until he died , way late .
477: [I] The moment I graduated from Princeton University , do you know what I was doing when they called my name on Cannon Green ?
477: [my] The moment I graduated from Princeton University , do you know what I was doing when they called my name on Cannon Green ?
479: [I] I was sitting under a shade tree in Avondale eating a sandwich with two guys .
481: [I] I was a garbage man the summer between Princeton and law school .
481: [a garbage man] I was a garbage man the summer between Princeton and law school .
482: [I] My dad always exercised all of his considerable influence and connections to not only get me a summer job that started -- I 'd get off the red-eye flight at four in the morning , and would always start to work at six-thirty that same morning , and that was my summer vacation .
482: [My] My dad always exercised all of his considerable influence and connections to not only get me a summer job that started -- I 'd get off the red-eye flight at four in the morning , and would always start to work at six-thirty that same morning , and that was my summer vacation .
482: [me] My dad always exercised all of his considerable influence and connections to not only get me a summer job that started -- I 'd get off the red-eye flight at four in the morning , and would always start to work at six-thirty that same morning , and that was my summer vacation .
482: [my] My dad always exercised all of his considerable influence and connections to not only get me a summer job that started -- I 'd get off the red-eye flight at four in the morning , and would always start to work at six-thirty that same morning , and that was my summer vacation .
483: [me] But he would always exercise his influence and get me the dirtiest , hardest , nastiest , lowest paying job in the City of Birmingham .
484: [I] That summer George Seibels was , I think , president of the city council .
485: [I] I do n't think he was mayor yet .
489: [I] I and the crew were getting the mayor 's garbage and putting it in the back of the truck .
491: [I] The night before my dad and I had been talking .
491: [my] The night before my dad and I had been talking .
494: [I] The day or two before the city council had passed an increase in the -- I 've forgotten which it was .
496: [My] My dad thought they should have done it the other way around because the airlines could avoid it by gassing up in Atlanta or somewhere else .
497: [I] He and I had been talking about the increase in the millage on the gasoline as opposed to the increase in the landing fees and the philosophy .
503: [I] I very timidly raised my hand , just as innocent as you can be .
503: [my] I very timidly raised my hand , just as innocent as you can be .
504: [my] He said , `` Yes , my boy . ''
505: [I] He did n't recognize me because in the first place it was misty , and in the second place I was covered with garbage .
505: [me] He did n't recognize me because in the first place it was misty , and in the second place I was covered with garbage .
506: [I] I said , `` Yes , sir , mayor .
507: [me] Can you explain to me why you increased the mileage on the gasoline as opposed to the landing fees because -- '' for several reasons we 'd talked about .
509: [I] He looked like he 'd been hit with a wet fish , and I realized in a flash that it must have gone through his mind , `` Who on earth is hiring these garbage men ? '' His response was , `` Bless you boys , '' and he spun on his heels and went back in the house .
510: [I] But George Seibels was one of the people of good will that I 'm talking about .
514: [I] I do n't know maybe the details .
523: [my] That is , in part , why my dad was frustrated because nobody could do anything with old Bull , and that , in large measure , is what lead to the change in the form of city government .
524: [I] So the answer to your question , `` Do I know any of the details of the change of the police , '' I guess I have known , but it does n't really matter because all of those developments and changes in that period would be responsive to the change in the form of government as opposed to any real reformist movement in the city .
532: [My] My daddy was mayor at the time that that was going on .
533: [I] Then and up until his death David Vann , my dad , and I always remained very good friends .
533: [my] Then and up until his death David Vann , my dad , and I always remained very good friends .
534: [I] That idea that political differences would segue into personal differences -- I guess maybe it 's a lawyer frame of mind , or at least was then -- that you could have honestly held disagreements on important issues and still have a lot of admiration and respect for each other as a person .
535: [I] That 's the way I feel about David Vann .
540: [I] The Civil Rights Institute , I do n't know what your question is .
541: [my] What about it ? Is it what are my thoughts about it and the like ?
544: [I] I think that the Civil Rights Institute is a very good thing because it 's a museum , and what is a museum for ? It 's to preserve history .
545: [I] I believe that we must make the Civil Rights Movement history rather than current events to lay that issue to rest .
546: [I] I think it 's important that we lay it to rest .
548: [I] I went to visit some aging cousins of mine who had blue hair and were in their 90s twenty years ago .
551: [My] My multi-great grand daddy rode off to the Revolutionary War from Jonesboro , Georgia , so we are from the South .
553: [I] I guess they 're all dead now .
554: [I] I have n't had any contact with them , but they were made twenty years ago .
567: [I] I do n't understand the question .
581: [my] Now the truth of the matter is , as my dad always said until the day he died , `` They talk about the good old days .
585: [I] I guess that 's the answer .
592: [I] I do n't know whether I answered it .
598: [I] As far as I 'm concerned Bernard Kincaid is not a good administrator .
604: [my] For my book one 's better than the other for the job .
605: [I] That 's the best I can tell you .
609: [I] I do n't know what you 're interested in .
611: [I] To that extent I 've tried to participate .
612: [me] Tell me what particular questions you have , what thoughts you have ?
615: [me] A change in what respect ? Tell me the change .
618: [I] Sixty-three to seventy-seven , I 'll tell you .
626: [I] You know what I 'm talking about .
628: [I] I was at Princeton from Birmingham in 1961 when the picture of the dog was on the front page of The New York Times .

 19: [a city] He was born at the site of Phillips High School downtown before Birmingham was a city .
 23: [Birmingham] I was raised in Birmingham , but we lived in Chicago and Washington , D. C. when my dad was in the FBI .
 38: [Birmingham] In 1965 I was in law school , and my dad had left the office of mayor of Birmingham and not run for a second term .
 54: [Birmingham] I came back to Birmingham to get my dad and our files .
 97: [Birmingham] Our theme of the case was that Bob Chambliss was just a mean , racist old man , as there were 30,000 of in Birmingham in 1963 , that he was rough talking , that he was rough , and that he was mean , but that did n't mean that he did this horrible crime .
100: [Birmingham] He had quite a history of violence and the like around Birmingham .
176: [Birmingham] So how was the guilty verdict received in Birmingham in 77 ? Do you feel like there was relief ?
179: [Birmingham] That was the first of the times , totally undeserved nonetheless true , Birmingham had been pilloried in the media of the world , and there was this collective societal desire to purge ourselves of this demon , so I think it probably was well received at the time .
232: [Birmingham] I went the front door , and it was one of those clear , rare , low humidity Birmingham days , in the 70s maybe .
324: [Birmingham] I mean , bear in mind , I had three great grand daddies rode off from this valley before Birmingham was a city .
324: [a city] I mean , bear in mind , I had three great grand daddies rode off from this valley before Birmingham was a city .
330: [Birmingham] He was mayor of Birmingham .
336: [a city] I 've known everybody in town , if that 's possible in a city this size , my whole life .
348: [Birmingham] When you were a young man of some promise with a daddy who would vouch for you , and you knew those people , that 's the way those things worked even in Birmingham , and certainly throughout the South in those days .
383: [Birmingham] Birmingham and Atlanta were about the same size , and his hope , his whole goal -- he was in great competition with the mayor of Atlanta .
383: [his whole goal] Birmingham and Atlanta were about the same size , and his hope , his whole goal -- he was in great competition with the mayor of Atlanta .
386: [Birmingham] In fact , Birmingham was running ahead .
387: [Birmingham] Geographically it makes more sense to go to Birmingham than to Atlanta for the airlines , and this civil rights movement was just killing Birmingham , just killing us .
387: [it] Geographically it makes more sense to go to Birmingham than to Atlanta for the airlines , and this civil rights movement was just killing Birmingham , just killing us .
388: [Birmingham] My dad was so agonized over it , and he was also so very worried about the potential for violence in Birmingham .
388: [it] My dad was so agonized over it , and he was also so very worried about the potential for violence in Birmingham .
389: [it] He talked to the president about it .
391: [Birmingham] His reasoning was that knowing the people of Birmingham that they would literally die , that there would be tremendous unrest if you forced it on the children , boom , from scratch .

483: [Birmingham] But he would always exercise his influence and get me the dirtiest , hardest , nastiest , lowest paying job in the City of Birmingham .
495: [Birmingham] They 'd either passed an increase in the gasoline fuel tax in Birmingham as opposed to an increase in the landing fees .
516: [Birmingham] Bear in mind , we changed the form of city government from the commission form to the mayor/council form in what , '62 or ' 63 ? That 's where Albert Boutwell came from , and that resulted in a radical , radical change in the way government was operated in the whole construction of the city of Birmingham .
522: [controlling Birmingham] That 's why Bull Connor as police commissioner was almost unbridled in what he could do in controlling Birmingham .
528: [Birmingham] All good young lawyers then were part of the change of form of government and instrumental in it , and had figured out that the only way to get rid of Bull Connor and that kind of approach to policing in Birmingham was to change the form of government and put it in the hands of the council .
558: [Birmingham] So Birmingham has changed now , very much for the better ?
561: [Birmingham] Oh heavenly days ! Birmingham operated well within budget in those days .
562: [Birmingham] Now Birmingham is virtually broke .
578: [Birmingham] You used to come over the mountain , and you could tell how the economic life in Birmingham was by looking into the valley .
594: [Birmingham] We were talking about things fading into history , and I was just thinking about Birmingham today .
614: [Birmingham] My focus is on the trial , but I 'm just trying to gauge change in Birmingham .
620: [Birmingham] In 1963 the populous of Birmingham was resistant .
621: [Birmingham] The population of Birmingham was very , very antagonistic toward change .
623: [Birmingham] In 1977 the population of Birmingham was ready to capitulate , was ready , `` Please , leave us alone .
625: [Birmingham] Until this good day the idea of Birmingham raises certain specters in people 's minds .
627: [Birmingham] You 've been to Harvard from Birmingham .
630: [Birmingham] But yeah , in 1977 , yes , the people of Birmingham were desirous of laying it to rest .
631: [Birmingham] In 1963 the people of Birmingham were desirous of fighting to the last man .
632: [Birmingham] In Birmingham the War Between the States passed into history between '63 and ' 77 .

127: [he] At any rate , he insisted on not testifying .
128: [That] That would n't have been so bad , and then to compound things he insisted on calling some of his sorry old buddies to testify as to his character , and the net result of that was we did n't have our story , and yet he opened the door so Bill Baxley could just nail him with all this other reputation stuff .

219: [I] I would .
