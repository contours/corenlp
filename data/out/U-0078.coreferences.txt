"the last Baxley in my ancestral line that was not born in Alabama"
Baxley [PERSON], Alabama [LOCATION]
  1: [William J. Baxley .] William J. Baxley .
  2: [his] We 're here in Birmingham , Alabama , at his office .
  5: [Bill Baxley] This is Bill Baxley , and it is Thursday , May 22 , 2003 .
 11: [I] Okay , I was born in Dothan , Alabama , which is in the southeast corner of Alabama .
 13: [Baxley] My ancestors on the Baxley side were probably the first , if not they were among the first , white European people in that area .
 13: [My] My ancestors on the Baxley side were probably the first , if not they were among the first , white European people in that area .
 14: [Baxley] In fact , going back on the Baxley side , the last Baxley in my ancestral line that was not born in Alabama was born in the 1700s .

 14: [the last Baxley in my ancestral line that was not born in Alabama] In fact , going back on the Baxley side , the last Baxley in my ancestral line that was not born in Alabama was born in the 1700s .
 17: [I] I think three of my great grandfathers were wounded .
 18: [I] I think one of them more than once , and some of them were captured , wounded and captured , released , and wounded again .
 19: [I] I think one of them got some job later working in the salt works in Pensacola and that somehow exempted him from having to be in the Army .
 20: [I] I think it was classified as necessary labor , but three of them were soldiers during almost the whole war .
 21: [I] My roots are all in the south , mostly in Alabama , and mostly in the little corner of Alabama where I was born .
 21: [My] My roots are all in the south , mostly in Alabama , and mostly in the little corner of Alabama where I was born .
 22: [I] I was educated in the public schools of Dothan and went to the University of Alabama to both undergraduate and law school .
 23: [I] I finished law school in ' 64 .
 24: [I] I finished Dothan High School in ' 58 .
 27: [I] Well , I had , I suppose , for years decided I wanted to give a try to politics because of my feelings about civil rights .
 27: [my] Well , I had , I suppose , for years decided I wanted to give a try to politics because of my feelings about civil rights .
 28: [I] At first when I was following the news , the bus boycott in Montgomery and things of that nature , I was still in high school in ninth or tenth grade .
 29: [I] Even earlier than that , the earliest I remember as a child , a real small child , I wondered about the treatment of black people that my family would teach me to respect and love , playmates , ladies that worked in our house and kept me and my brother .

 30: [my] One of their sons that was older that kept us after school was out so that my mother could work , after we started school .
 33: [I] I would ask my parents at a very young age and never get very satisfactory answers , in fact , not satisfactory at all .
 33: [my] I would ask my parents at a very young age and never get very satisfactory answers , in fact , not satisfactory at all .
 34: [I] I never got answers that made any sense whatsoever .
 35: [My] My parents were good people .
 41: [I] At some point I thought I wanted to leave , but then at some time in college I decided if you wanted to stay and change that the way to do it was in politics .
 42: [I] I felt like by then I perhaps had a knack for politics so that 's how I decided I 'd go into politics .
 43: [I] I always liked the excitement of it anyway .
 44: [I] Early on I wanted to be a baseball player , but it became pretty obvious at an early age I did n't have any talent .
 45: [I] I finished law school , clerked for a year at the state supreme court .
 48: [I] I watched a lot of the famous arguments in front of Judge Frank Johnson .
 49: [My] My roommate , who 'd been one of my classmates in law school , was clerking with Judge Johnson so he got me in for every big argument on every case in front of Judge Johnson .
 49: [me] My roommate , who 'd been one of my classmates in law school , was clerking with Judge Johnson so he got me in for every big argument on every case in front of Judge Johnson .
 50: [I] I watched them all .
 51: [I] I went off for a little while in service , basic training , and then came back to Dothan and went in with a law firm .
 52: [I] An opening came up for District Attorney , and I decided to go for it , and became District Attorney at a very young age , twenty-four or five .
 53: [I] I was a very aggressive prosecutor , and I think had somewhat of a knack for being a courtroom lawyer .
 53: [a very aggressive prosecutor] I was a very aggressive prosecutor , and I think had somewhat of a knack for being a courtroom lawyer .
 54: [I] I prepared my cases well and got something of a reputation , I suppose , for being an aggressive advocate .
 54: [my] I prepared my cases well and got something of a reputation , I suppose , for being an aggressive advocate .
 55: [I] I decided in 1970 to run for Attorney General and ran against an incumbent .
 56: [me] Nobody much gave me a chance .
 57: [I] I had a lot of good help and put together a campaign that I 'm still very proud of and unseated the incumbent Attorney General who had four years before set the record for the most votes ever received up to that point .
 58: [I] I think I was twenty-eight when I got elected .
 58: [twenty-eight when I got elected] I think I was twenty-eight when I got elected .
 59: [I] Then I had a birthday and I was twenty-nine when I got sworn in , and decided that that was the opportunity to do what I felt like I could for changing the way that we treated a third of our population and advancing what I believed to be the legitimate goals of the civil rights movement .
 59: [twenty-nine when I got sworn in , and decided that that was the opportunity to do what I felt like I could for changing the way that we treated a third of our population and advancing what I believed to be the legitimate goals of the civil rights movement] Then I had a birthday and I was twenty-nine when I got sworn in , and decided that that was the opportunity to do what I felt like I could for changing the way that we treated a third of our population and advancing what I believed to be the legitimate goals of the civil rights movement .
 60: [I] I thought , `` If you do n't do something now you might not ever have this chance again . ''
 61: [I] I started being pretty active in that area , did a lot of things .
 62: [I] One of the first things that I did was open the bombing investigation because it , more than anything else , had really affected me by making me want to stay in Alabama .
 62: [me] One of the first things that I did was open the bombing investigation because it , more than anything else , had really affected me by making me want to stay in Alabama .
 63: [me] It sickened me , the climate that had allowed these kind of atrocities to happen , that being the worst of many atrocities .
 69: [I] The things that I did in civil rights early on that got publicity were n't related to that investigation because it was many years before that became public .
 70: [me] Do you want me to keep going about civil rights , or do you want to stick to the bombing investigation ?
 73: [I] Well , at the time I came in , there were a lot of cases pending about the way various public officials in the South were trying to , in essence , hold back the tide .
 76: [I] At the time I came in Alabama was a party in several cases where we were trying to either delay or stop some aspect of equal rights , primarily jury service , jury duty , voting .
 81: [I] Several of the southern states , I wo n't try to -- I do remember for sure Mississippi was one .
 82: [I] As I recall there were four .
 83: [I] It could have been five , but Alabama was one of them , and they had filed these suits that I do n't think made any sense , logic , or anything else .
 84: [I] As I recall California and maybe Massachusetts tried to force busing with some convoluted theory that if you made them have busing in the North that that would make people quit trying to integrate the South .
 85: [me] It did n't make any sense to me .
 86: [I] I failed to see how taking positions like that in the North would help them defend those things in the South .
 87: [I] Before I even went into office , after I 'd been elected but before I went into office , I said we were going to get out of those my first day .
 87: [my] Before I even went into office , after I 'd been elected but before I went into office , I said we were going to get out of those my first day .
 88: [I] I 'll never forget .
 89: [I] I was in Meredian , Mississippi .
 90: [I] I had gone to visit some friends in Butler , Alabama , and we had gone over to Meredian to eat lunch because a -RRB- Meredian had better restaurants than they did in Butler , and b -RRB- Meredian , this was the main reason , at that time was `` wet , '' and Choctaw County , Alabama was `` dry , '' so we went over to Meredian .
 96: [I] I only drank beer , but I 'd had seven , eight , ten of them by then .
 98: [I] He said he was looking forward to me going to those cases with him , that they all had a good time going to the hearings , the cases I 'm talking about in California , Massachusetts , or wherever they had them .
 98: [me] He said he was looking forward to me going to those cases with him , that they all had a good time going to the hearings , the cases I 'm talking about in California , Massachusetts , or wherever they had them .
 99: [I] I said , `` I 'm not going to be going .
100: [I] I 'm going to get us out of there the first day I 'm in office . ''
105: [I] I said , `` That would be another reason for me to get out .
105: [me] I said , `` That would be another reason for me to get out .
106: [I] I 'm not going to be a cheerleader .
107: [I] If I 'm going to go court I 'm going to be the one doing the arguments . ''
108: [I] Anyway , I told him I was going to get out , and he tried to talk me out of it .
108: [me] Anyway , I told him I was going to get out , and he tried to talk me out of it .
109: [I] A couple of years later -- I was single .
111: [I] She and I dated for a little while .
113: [I] She told me later that he called her in and said , `` You know Vee , I know that young man that 's Attorney General of Alabama '' -- he 'd found out that she and I had had some dates and she 'd been over here .
113: [me] She told me later that he called her in and said , `` You know Vee , I know that young man that 's Attorney General of Alabama '' -- he 'd found out that she and I had had some dates and she 'd been over here .
114: [I] He said , `` I know he 's probably a charming fellow .
115: [I] I 'm sure he 's a lot of fun to be with .
118: [I] I always got a kick out of that .
119: [I] I was very fond of him .
120: [I] Anyway , getting back to the point , shortly after I was in office , a few weeks , maybe just a few days , the head of our civil division who at the time was a lawyer by the name of Gordon Madison .
122: [my] He was an older man about my dad 's age or maybe even older .
124: [I] He was widely recognized when I came in as the best , most able lawyer in the Attorney General 's office -- career lawyer .
125: [I] Later the people I brought in were also very , very able , but of the ones there he was by far , I think , the most able .
126: [I] I got a list of all the cases that were pending in Alabama , obstructionist type cases on these voting rights matters and others .
127: [I] I said I wanted him to go down and dismiss them all .
129: [I] One day shortly after I was in office Gordon Madison went down and dismissed on my orders all of the cases that the state had brought trying to obstruct enforcement of these rights .
129: [my] One day shortly after I was in office Gordon Madison went down and dismissed on my orders all of the cases that the state had brought trying to obstruct enforcement of these rights .
130: [I] I think we might have also dismissed some defenses or things in cases where we were defendants .
131: [me] Late that afternoon they said that Mr. Madison needed to see me .
132: [I] I was really busy .
133: [I] I thought , `` Uh-oh , what does he want ? '' They said , `` He says he 's got to talk to you . ''
134: [I] I was a little bit afraid that he may come in and say he was so upset with me doing that that he was going to quit or some thing like that I did n't know how he felt .
134: [me] I was a little bit afraid that he may come in and say he was so upset with me doing that that he was going to quit or some thing like that I did n't know how he felt .
135: [I] Like I say , he was my dad 's age , but he was well thought of .
135: [my] Like I say , he was my dad 's age , but he was well thought of .
136: [My] My dad thought a lot of him and was very fond of him .
138: [I] So I said , `` Well , all right .
139: [I] I 'll see him . ''
140: [I] So he came in and sat down and said , `` I hate to take up your time , but I just want to tell you something . ''
141: [I] He said , `` I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to do what I did in court today .
141: [me] He said , `` I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to do what I did in court today .
142: [I] This is the first time in a long , long time since I 've worked for the state that I held my head up high after I left the courthouse . ''
142: [my] This is the first time in a long , long time since I 've worked for the state that I held my head up high after I left the courthouse . ''
143: [me] It really affected me .
144: [I] It still does when I think about a distinguished gentleman like Gordon Madison coming in and saying that .
145: [I] It made me know that I was n't going to be fighting a lonely battle .
145: [me] It made me know that I was n't going to be fighting a lonely battle .
147: [I] I do n't mean to give the impression -- let me correct this early on -- even in college or now that all I thought about was civil rights .
147: [me] I do n't mean to give the impression -- let me correct this early on -- even in college or now that all I thought about was civil rights .
148: [I] Gosh , I was a wild person about partying and having fun .
148: [a wild person about partying and having fun] Gosh , I was a wild person about partying and having fun .
149: [I] I did other cases , too , that did n't have anything to do with civil rights , and I like to think did them well , and enjoyed life .
150: [I] I do n't want people to think that I was obsessed with only that .
151: [I] But , I reckon the next thing I started out trying to break the color line , so to speak , and hire some black assistant attorneys general .
153: [I] I found him through the help of my father who was friends with his grandfather , a gentleman from Dothan , a gentleman by the name of John Henry Glanton whose son for years was on the Dothan city council .
153: [my] I found him through the help of my father who was friends with his grandfather , a gentleman from Dothan , a gentleman by the name of John Henry Glanton whose son for years was on the Dothan city council .
155: [I] By the time I hired Myron Thompson I think the only blacks that worked for the state were custodial , janitorial people , other than those that taught in the public schools .
164: [me] After several years with me he left and went back to Dothan and had a very successful law practice there before he was appointed to the bench .
165: [I] I got three or four hate letters about that , and that was all .
169: [I] Shortly behind Myron we brought in we brought in Dan Thompson who 'd finished at Harvard Law School , then later I think became general council for Potomac Bell or maybe AT&T or something .
171: [I] Some of his people were from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , and I think he preferred the East so he moved back , but he was a great addition also .
176: [I] He was , I believe , head of the VA Hospital in Tuskegee , and Myron 's family was educated .
179: [I] He was the toughest prosecutor I ever had on my staff , maybe other than me .
179: [me] He was the toughest prosecutor I ever had on my staff , maybe other than me .
179: [my] He was the toughest prosecutor I ever had on my staff , maybe other than me .
180: [me] He left me and went to work in Montgomery , became an assistant DA and city judge for Montgomery , and for the last twenty years probably , has been circuit judge .
182: [I] I think Milton Davis was next .
187: [I] Oh , I lost track .
189: [I] I think that was a few years later .
193: [I] I think if we had n't aggressively gone out and tried to recruit them , I think that a lot of them might not have come back to Alabama because there were no opportunities for them here , and we , we the people here , would have lost these brilliant minds .
194: [I] When they ask me what I think my best accomplishment in public service is I say quickly , and I mean this with all my heart , it 's the people , black and white , male and female , that I brought back to go to work for the state because many of them would not have come back to Alabama .
194: [me] When they ask me what I think my best accomplishment in public service is I say quickly , and I mean this with all my heart , it 's the people , black and white , male and female , that I brought back to go to work for the state because many of them would not have come back to Alabama .

196: [I] I think that would have been a brain drain , and I think that that 's easily my greatest accomplishment , being able to bring those people back to Alabama .
196: [my] I think that would have been a brain drain , and I think that that 's easily my greatest accomplishment , being able to bring those people back to Alabama .
197: [I] I suppose somewhere along that time , I think it was May of ' 71 , four or five months after I took office Sheriff Amerson , who was the first elected black sheriff in modern times in the South , had been indicted by the federal government .
198: [I] I thought it would send the wrong signal for him to be removed , and I felt like he had some justification for what had happened so I came in and offered to defend him .
202: [I] Most of them I tried myself , and I think we won all of them .
202: [myself] Most of them I tried myself , and I think we won all of them .
203: [I] I do n't even remember now losing a case .
206: [I] Fred represented Sheriff Amerson with me , and he and I tried the case .
206: [me] Fred represented Sheriff Amerson with me , and he and I tried the case .
207: [I] I think it was an all white jury , but we won the case .
208: [I] Oh gosh , that 's about as much background as I can remember right now off the top of my head .
208: [my] Oh gosh , that 's about as much background as I can remember right now off the top of my head .
218: [I] They were operating out of , I think , Marietta , Georgia , at the time we started investigating .
220: [I] I think he was originally from Chattanooga , Tennessee , or Look Out Mountain .
228: [I] That 's why we could get Chambliss , and why even recently in the last couple of years they could go back and get Blanton and Cherry because on a murder , not just a civil rights murder , any murder , in state court in Alabama there is no statute of limitations , and I think that 's as it should be .
229: [I] I 'm glad .
232: [I] So we had to just put it on the back burner , and we were continuing to really go after the one where the deaths , the little girls were killed , Sixteenth Street , and it just became obvious , like I said , he did a lot of others but not that one .
237: [I] I was lucky there .
238: [I] I had Jack Shaws , who was my chief investigator .
238: [my] I had Jack Shaws , who was my chief investigator .
243: [I] I think that came after .
244: [I] I do n't think we got that indictment until after we indicted for the bombing though , but we came back to it and got an indictment eventually .
245: [my] In my opinion we solved the case .
250: [my] By then we were several years into my term .
253: [I] It got to a point where I knew that we were going to have to get access to the FBI records if we were going to have any success , and so I started trying to get the FBI 's cooperation and was met with one story and tale after another .
255: [I] I was patient a lot longer than I should have been .
256: [I] The reason I was patient is I felt like that there was probably good reason for them to be suspicious of a deep South law enforcement agency because of the bad record they 'd had in the past .
257: [I] I think the FBI is due a lot of credit for what they did to break the back of the Klan , and they 're certainly deserving of a lot of credit , and J. Edgar Hoover is deserving of a lot .
258: [I] What they did to come in in the '50s and the '60s , particularly in the '60s , what they did I had nothing but admiration for it .
260: [I] So I said , well , I 'm standing there reluctant .
261: [I] I want to show them how they can trust me , and I spent a lot of time trying to show them how I had worked with the FBI as a young prosecutor , how I knew these agents that I felt like would vouch for me , how we certainly did n't have any connection with the Klan .
261: [me] I want to show them how they can trust me , and I spent a lot of time trying to show them how I had worked with the FBI as a young prosecutor , how I knew these agents that I felt like would vouch for me , how we certainly did n't have any connection with the Klan .
268: [I] But , I did n't get anywhere with being patient .
270: [I] Hoover died , and I thought maybe after he was gone that I might have better luck .
273: [I] I ca n't remember when Clarence Kelley came in , but anyway nothing changed with the FBI .
275: [I] One day , by then I 'm probably in my second term , it 's probably '75 maybe , even '76 perhaps , probably ' 75 , early ' 761 suspect .
275: [my] One day , by then I 'm probably in my second term , it 's probably '75 maybe , even '76 perhaps , probably ' 75 , early ' 761 suspect .
276: [I] I was in Washington , and I had a good friend that was the LA Times bureau chief named Jack Nelson .
278: [I] When I would go to Washington I would try to get with Jack , and we 'd go out to dinner or something .
279: [I] I 'd go over to his house .
281: [I] So we went out one night , and he wanted to know if I was still working on the bombing case , and I said , `` Yeah . ''
282: [I] I said , `` I think we 've reached an impasse , '' and I told him about the trouble .
283: [I] He knew I 'd been working on it for years .
284: [I] I told him about the problem that we had , if we could n't get the cooperation of the FBI that I did n't think we were going to be able to do anything , and said we just had to have it , and all the troubles and years I 'd gone through trying to get it .
285: [I] He said , `` I think I can help you if you want me to . ''
285: [me] He said , `` I think I can help you if you want me to . ''
286: [I] He said , `` If you do n't think it 's meddling , I 'll do what I can to help you .
287: [I] I know it 's the right thing to do . ''
288: [I] I said , `` Man , yeah , I wish you would . ''
289: [I] I said , `` It ca n't hurt us .
294: [I] I 'll see what I can do . ''
295: [me] So the next day he called me at the hotel .
296: [me] He said , `` You know we plotted this thing of me helping you with the FBI , and we had had a lot to drink .
297: [I] Do you still want me to do that in the cold light of morning ? '' I said , `` Yeah .
297: [me] Do you still want me to do that in the cold light of morning ? '' I said , `` Yeah .
301: [I] By then Gerald Ford is President , and I 'm trying to remember who the Attorney General was .
305: [I] He says he 's working on a big story , and it 's not going to be just a story it 's going to be a whole series of stuff , and that the FBI is covering up for the killers of the little girls and that they wo n't cooperate with Attorney General of Alabama who 's got a legitimate investigation , has legitimate credentials to prove he 's not connected with the Klan , and is on the verge of solving it , but the FBI is blocking it , and that he had gotten permission from his bosses at The LA Times -- which I suspect he made up -- that they were going to run it as a front page series for days if not weeks .
309: [I] He said , `` I 'll give you a reasonable amount of time . ''
310: [I] About I think it would have been two weeks , they called Nelson back .
315: [I] I think I was with Nelson .
320: [I] I had just hired a friend of mine that had been sheriff for a while .
324: [I] I called him and said , `` Bob , we have been working on this bombing case for years , but it 's been hits and misses , bits and pieces , false starts .
327: [I] I want you to stop what you 're doing .
328: [I] I 'm going to stop any assignments of any other work and you 're full time on the bombing case .
335: [I] So I 'll always be grateful and indebted to Bob Eddy and Jack Nelson both .
336: [I] Of course it turns out , and I only learned this the last couple of years when they tried Blanton and Cherry , that the FBI in spite of telling us they were cooperating still held out on us and did n't give us everything .
342: [I] It turns out I think we could have convicted Blanton for sure back when we convicted Chambliss and maybe Cherry also , although Cherry would be a little bit more iffy because a lot of stuff that they convicted Cherry on came out of his own mouth after the fact , bragging about what he had done .
344: [I] But Blanton I think for sure we could have convicted back when we did Chambliss .
360: [I] I vented at the FBI about this and got it out of my system kind of .
360: [my] I vented at the FBI about this and got it out of my system kind of .
361: [I] And I do n't blame the ones now .
366: [I] I shudder to think what would have happened in the South with racial hate crimes back then .
367: [I] That does n't mean that I think they 're all bad .
371: [my] For several reasons , and that was my call .
384: [I] So I said , `` We 'll just go with Chambliss and then come back and try to get the others . ''
385: [I] But then one other thing I wanted to be sure I came back to .
386: [I] I mentioned J. B. Stone had been our first suspect and done a lot of bombings , but just not the Sixteenth Street Church bombing , and that the statute of limitations had run .
387: [I] But we found , and I ca n't remember who in my office found this .
387: [my] But we found , and I ca n't remember who in my office found this .
388: [I] I think it might have been John Young who was one of my assistant attorneys general .
393: [I] So I said , `` You know , that 's worth a try . ''
394: [I] So what we indicted Chambliss for -- I 'm sorry -- what we indicted Stoner for -- we could prove that case -- was not setting off the bomb at the church because the statute of limitations had run on that .
401: [I] I do n't know how much you want to get into the trial of Chambliss .
405: [I] I really like and have a lot of respect for the Haneses .
408: [I] We had a jury , I think there were nine whites and three blacks , or ten whites and two blacks .
410: [I] I can still think back to a lot of emotions I had .
411: [I] I 'm just thankful I was able to play a part in some long overdue justice .
413: [I] Of course , we were doing a lot of other injuries to ourselves back in those days then without that , but I 'm just glad I was able to be a part of finally bringing that first part of it to trial , and I 'm glad that somebody like Doug Jones -- Doug Jones was a young law student at the time of the Chambliss trial .
415: [I] I think he watched my final argument .
415: [my] I think he watched my final argument .
419: [I] It came out that he had reopened the case as U. S. Attorney , and I called him .
421: [I] I know Doug well and tried a lot of cases with him and against him .
422: [me] He called me to tell me what he was doing .
423: [I] I saw it in the paper .
424: [I] I might have called him or he called me .
424: [me] I might have called him or he called me .
425: [I] I ca n't remember .
426: [I] I said , `` Doug , how in the world are you going to be able to do anything ? The federal statute ran years ago .
428: [I] He said , `` Well , I know that . ''
433: [me] David Barber , the DA here , cooperated like the DA had done with me .
436: [I] Back when I was trying to be patient with the FBI and trying to explain to them the logic of where they ought to cooperate and share , I would tell them , `` You know , I understand .
438: [I] I understand you ca n't let somebody come in and mess up a case of yours by sharing your stuff , but you have no case .
441: [I] If these people were to run out and say , ' I did it , yeah , yeah , yeah , ' there 's nothing that you could do federally to them .
443: [I] That was another thing that I could n't understand and still do n't .
444: [I] I know the reasons they gave never were logical and still are n't .
449: [I] Well , that is a matter that I can take their side on .
451: [I] They had more evidence than what I had to convict Chambliss , but , and this is a big but -- I mentioned early on when I was talking about Jack Shaws , my chief investigator , saw Martin Luther King 's house and church bombing in Montgomery and got confessions , and juries turned them loose even with confessions .
451: [my] They had more evidence than what I had to convict Chambliss , but , and this is a big but -- I mentioned early on when I was talking about Jack Shaws , my chief investigator , saw Martin Luther King 's house and church bombing in Montgomery and got confessions , and juries turned them loose even with confessions .
454: [I] I think that that was Hoover 's fear , that he felt like that even with the good evidence they had it still was n't iron clad .
456: [I] I can take his side on that issue .
457: [I] I can see where he would say , `` We ought not to run the risk of acquittal , '' with the way juries were doing .
458: [I] But I ca n't take their side in not later sharing that with me where I could have a chance , or we could have a chance , to bring the people that they knew were guilty , and they knew were their suspects , to help us prosecute it , especially to act like and make us think that they were helping .
459: [I] And in a way I reckon they were .
461: [I] I told them later , `` The problem is my definition and your definition of cooperation is not the same thing . ''
461: [my] I told them later , `` The problem is my definition and your definition of cooperation is not the same thing . ''
472: [I] It 's a source of , I suppose you 'd say , pride in my state , pride that they finally did .
472: [my] It 's a source of , I suppose you 'd say , pride in my state , pride that they finally did .
477: [I] I think probably the first one you 've got to start with was a lady from Detroit named Miss Kirthus Glenn .
484: [I] I sent investigators to Detroit .
485: [I] We found her , and Jack Shaws and I ca n't remember who else , went up there and talked to her .
487: [I] When they came back and told me that I said , `` Well , the witness is n't going to be any good if she wo n't come back . ''
487: [me] When they came back and told me that I said , `` Well , the witness is n't going to be any good if she wo n't come back . ''
490: [I] So I said , `` You all just have n't tried .
494: [I] I thought they just had n't done it properly , so I sent them back up there .
496: [I] I said , `` You all are just -- . ''
497: [I] I did n't say incompetent .
498: [I] If I did it was in a laughing way .
499: [I] I said , `` I 'll go up there with you . ''
500: [I] So I got one of the black assistant attorneys general , Milton Belcher -- Governor Wallace had let us use the state plane to fly all over on this case .
501: [I] So we flew back , I think this was the third time , and I said , `` You all just watch me .
501: [me] So we flew back , I think this was the third time , and I said , `` You all just watch me .
502: [I] I 'll show you how it 's done . ''
503: [I] I still could n't get it done .
506: [me] But we noticed , Shaws had told me this , that he 'd noticed it before .
509: [I] So I picked up that magazine and thumbed through the story on Rosa Parks .
512: [I] Now Fred and I had become really good friends .
513: [I] Early in this interview , if you might remember , I was telling he and I defended Sheriff Amerson together , okay ? Fred by then was in the Alabama legislature , and we were good friends and still are .
514: [I] Like I say , he 's president of the Bar Association right now , state bar .
515: [I] So I asked Fred would he take off and fly up there for a fourth time .
516: [I] I said , `` If Martin Luther King 's lawyer comes up here and promises you that everything is okay and you 'll be safe , will you believe him ? '' And she says , `` Well , yeah , I 'd be hard pressed not to believe him . ''
520: [me] Let me finish the highlights of these witnesses .
524: [I] I 'm running out of time so we can schedule another session sometime .
526: [me] Let me skip .
531: [me] They brought me up here .
533: [I] I came up and talked to them and decided she 'd be a terrific witness .
544: [I] But Elizabeth Cobbs was the difference , I think , in winning and losing the case .
545: [me] That was to me the most dramatic moment in the trial when she came in , when she testified .
550: [I] I think without her testimony we would n't have won .
551: [I] Of course you 've got a lot of other things , but that 's the one that I would rate above all others as being the difference .
556: [I] In fact , I 'll close by telling a story that Art Hanes Junior told me , fairly recently , two or three years ago .
556: [me] In fact , I 'll close by telling a story that Art Hanes Junior told me , fairly recently , two or three years ago .
557: [me] Art told me that after the -- now you 've got to understand .
558: [me] Let me backtrack .
559: [I] Apparently a lot of these Klansmen were also , Cherry particularly , I think Blanton also , but I know Cherry was , were abusers .
563: [me] Art Junior told me that after the guilty verdict came down , of course they carried Chambliss away in handcuffs .
570: [I] Can I come in Mrs. Chambliss ? '' She says , `` Yes , come in . ''
572: [I] He thinks , `` Oh , as bad as she feels it 's going to be even a lot more awful when I tell her what happened . ''
573: [I] He said , `` Mrs. Chambliss , I 'm sorry to tell you that I 've got to come tell you that the jury found Bob guilty , '' or Robert guilty .
578: [I] She said , `` Well , when will he be coming home ? '' He said , `` I 'm afraid he wo n't be Mrs. Chambliss .
582: [I] If we lose the appeal I doubt at his age he 'll ever come home . ''
585: [I] She said , `` You sure he 's not going to come home ? '' He said , `` I 'm afraid so Mrs. Chambliss . ''
588: [I] So that 's how I 'm going to close my interview .
588: [my] So that 's how I 'm going to close my interview .

"injured Birmingham"
Birmingham [LOCATION]
  2: [Birmingham] We 're here in Birmingham , Alabama , at his office .
112: [Birmingham] She came over here to an Alabama/Old Miss game , to Birmingham .
236: [Birmingham] Sometime around that same time , or well not the same time , after we decided Stoner was n't the one , we got a tip that the Klan in Montgomery had come up to Birmingham and done the Sixteenth Street bombing , so we went back and started working that .
242: [Birmingham] Trying to check down our tips that the Montgomery Klan had bombed the Sixteenth Street Church in Birmingham , again it turned out they had n't , but they uncovered that the Klan had killed a young kid named Willie Edwards who was driving a truck for Winn Dixie , so we followed that down and ended up getting an indictment .
329: [Birmingham] Go to Birmingham and get you a motel room for however long -- .
332: [Birmingham] He came to Birmingham and established a relationship with the FBI office , got a motel room , and went to work full time on that .
334: [it] If it had n't been for Eddy , well , if it had n't been for Jack Nelson making the FBI finally cooperate we never would have been able to bring the prosecution , and if it had n't been for Eddy coming up here and putting all the pieces together and fitting it in with what we already had , we would n't have made it work .
336: [it] Of course it turns out , and I only learned this the last couple of years when they tried Blanton and Cherry , that the FBI in spite of telling us they were cooperating still held out on us and did n't give us everything .
412: [Birmingham] Chambliss was the main ring leader of that bombing that took those little innocent children 's lives , and as well injured Birmingham and Alabama in a way that we 're still recovering from .
412: [injured Birmingham] Chambliss was the main ring leader of that bombing that took those little innocent children 's lives , and as well injured Birmingham and Alabama in a way that we 're still recovering from .
478: [Birmingham] She had been in Birmingham the night of the bombing , and was staying in a house right behind the church , and saw the bomb being planted , and saw the car , and identified the people .

"Alabama '' -- he"
Alabama [LOCATION]
  2: [Alabama] We 're here in Birmingham , Alabama , at his office .
  3: [It] It is May 22,2003 , and the interviewer 's name is Willoughby Anderson .
 11: [Alabama] Okay , I was born in Dothan , Alabama , which is in the southeast corner of Alabama .
 12: [It] It 's ten miles from Florida and fifteen or so from Georgia .
 14: [Alabama] In fact , going back on the Baxley side , the last Baxley in my ancestral line that was not born in Alabama was born in the 1700s .
 21: [Alabama] My roots are all in the south , mostly in Alabama , and mostly in the little corner of Alabama where I was born .
 62: [Alabama] One of the first things that I did was open the bombing investigation because it , more than anything else , had really affected me by making me want to stay in Alabama .
 76: [Alabama] At the time I came in Alabama was a party in several cases where we were trying to either delay or stop some aspect of equal rights , primarily jury service , jury duty , voting .
 83: [Alabama] It could have been five , but Alabama was one of them , and they had filed these suits that I do n't think made any sense , logic , or anything else .
 90: [Alabama] I had gone to visit some friends in Butler , Alabama , and we had gone over to Meredian to eat lunch because a -RRB- Meredian had better restaurants than they did in Butler , and b -RRB- Meredian , this was the main reason , at that time was `` wet , '' and Choctaw County , Alabama was `` dry , '' so we went over to Meredian .
113: [Alabama '' -- he] She told me later that he called her in and said , `` You know Vee , I know that young man that 's Attorney General of Alabama '' -- he 'd found out that she and I had had some dates and she 'd been over here .
126: [Alabama] I got a list of all the cases that were pending in Alabama , obstructionist type cases on these voting rights matters and others .
161: [Alabama] He 's now the chief United States district judge for the middle district of Alabama .
193: [Alabama] I think if we had n't aggressively gone out and tried to recruit them , I think that a lot of them might not have come back to Alabama because there were no opportunities for them here , and we , we the people here , would have lost these brilliant minds .
194: [Alabama] When they ask me what I think my best accomplishment in public service is I say quickly , and I mean this with all my heart , it 's the people , black and white , male and female , that I brought back to go to work for the state because many of them would not have come back to Alabama .
195: [Alabama] The overwhelming majority of them stayed in Alabama after they came back .
196: [Alabama] I think that would have been a brain drain , and I think that that 's easily my greatest accomplishment , being able to bring those people back to Alabama .
228: [Alabama] That 's why we could get Chambliss , and why even recently in the last couple of years they could go back and get Blanton and Cherry because on a murder , not just a civil rights murder , any murder , in state court in Alabama there is no statute of limitations , and I think that 's as it should be .
277: [Alabama] Jack originally was from Alabama .
305: [Alabama] He says he 's working on a big story , and it 's not going to be just a story it 's going to be a whole series of stuff , and that the FBI is covering up for the killers of the little girls and that they wo n't cooperate with Attorney General of Alabama who 's got a legitimate investigation , has legitimate credentials to prove he 's not connected with the Klan , and is on the verge of solving it , but the FBI is blocking it , and that he had gotten permission from his bosses at The LA Times -- which I suspect he made up -- that they were going to run it as a front page series for days if not weeks .
305: [it] He says he 's working on a big story , and it 's not going to be just a story it 's going to be a whole series of stuff , and that the FBI is covering up for the killers of the little girls and that they wo n't cooperate with Attorney General of Alabama who 's got a legitimate investigation , has legitimate credentials to prove he 's not connected with the Klan , and is on the verge of solving it , but the FBI is blocking it , and that he had gotten permission from his bosses at The LA Times -- which I suspect he made up -- that they were going to run it as a front page series for days if not weeks .
392: [Alabama] People lived in them , and under the Alabama law there is no statute of limitations for setting off explosives dangerously near an occupied dwelling .
432: [Alabama] Attorney , but as a Special Assistant Attorney General of the State of Alabama .
452: [Alabama] But back in those days when the federal statute ran out in the '60s you only had white men on juries in most of Alabama , no females anywhere , and in most counties no blacks .
452: [Alabama , no females] But back in those days when the federal statute ran out in the '60s you only had white men on juries in most of Alabama , no females anywhere , and in most counties no blacks .
453: [Alabama] That was true not only in Alabama but in Mississippi and other parts of the deep South , so when you would find a few courageous prosecutors that would work up a case , and a few courageous law enforcement officers that would make them , they would invariably go before an all white , all male jury , and no matter what the evidence they had , they 'd turn them loose .
471: [Alabama] But three times juries in the state of Alabama did the right thing .
482: [Alabama] But she went back to Detroit and did n't want to ever come back to Alabama after that bombing right near her .
513: [Alabama] Early in this interview , if you might remember , I was telling he and I defended Sheriff Amerson together , okay ? Fred by then was in the Alabama legislature , and we were good friends and still are .

  3: [Willoughby Anderson] It is May 22,2003 , and the interviewer 's name is Willoughby Anderson .
 71: [I] I 'd like to hear about both .
211: [I] I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about specifically going after them .

330: [I] Okay , I think you can go ahead .

"Our evidence on Chambliss"
Chambliss [PERSON]
372: [Our evidence on Chambliss] Our evidence on Chambliss was stronger than on the others , and Chambliss also was the ring leader .

"Dothan"
Dothan [LOCATION]
 11: [Dothan] Okay , I was born in Dothan , Alabama , which is in the southeast corner of Alabama .

 51: [Dothan] I went off for a little while in service , basic training , and then came back to Dothan and went in with a law firm .
153: [Dothan] I found him through the help of my father who was friends with his grandfather , a gentleman from Dothan , a gentleman by the name of John Henry Glanton whose son for years was on the Dothan city council .
159: [Dothan] His mom and his step father were in Tuskegee and his grandparents in Dothan .
164: [Dothan] After several years with me he left and went back to Dothan and had a very successful law practice there before he was appointed to the bench .

"Georgia"
Georgia [LOCATION]
 12: [Georgia] It 's ten miles from Florida and fifteen or so from Georgia .
 78: [Georgia] The states , Mississippi , Georgia , maybe South Carolina , maybe Louisiana , several of the deep South states -- can you turn that off just a minute ?
218: [Georgia] They were operating out of , I think , Marietta , Georgia , at the time we started investigating .
221: [Georgia] As we developed the case we had a guy in Georgia who kept wanting to give us information on a Klansman and wanting to be paid , and he said Stoner had done the bombings .

"My ancestors on the Baxley side"
Baxley [PERSON]
 13: [My ancestors on the Baxley side] My ancestors on the Baxley side were probably the first , if not they were among the first , white European people in that area .
 13: [they] My ancestors on the Baxley side were probably the first , if not they were among the first , white European people in that area .
 15: [They] They came here -- fathers fought in the Civil War for the South .
 16: [their] Several of their brothers were killed .

"the Baxley side"
Baxley [PERSON]
 13: [the Baxley side] My ancestors on the Baxley side were probably the first , if not they were among the first , white European people in that area .
 14: [the Baxley side] In fact , going back on the Baxley side , the last Baxley in my ancestral line that was not born in Alabama was born in the 1700s .

"claim that Chambliss ' health prevented him from going on trial , and make us"
Chambliss [PERSON]
381: [claim that Chambliss ' health prevented him from going on trial , and make us] And claim that Chambliss ' health prevented him from going on trial , and make us go to trial with one of the ones that we did n't have as good of evidence on .
382: [it] Then if we got a not guilty that would have knocked it in the head forever .

"the South"
South [LOCATION]
 15: [the South] They came here -- fathers fought in the Civil War for the South .
 21: [the south] My roots are all in the south , mostly in Alabama , and mostly in the little corner of Alabama where I was born .
 73: [the South] Well , at the time I came in , there were a lot of cases pending about the way various public officials in the South were trying to , in essence , hold back the tide .
 75: [the South] Civil rights acts had passed a few years before , but the implementation of them was still an ongoing battle in some parts of the state and in a lot of parts of the South .
 78: [South Carolina] The states , Mississippi , Georgia , maybe South Carolina , maybe Louisiana , several of the deep South states -- can you turn that off just a minute ?
 84: [the South] As I recall California and maybe Massachusetts tried to force busing with some convoluted theory that if you made them have busing in the North that that would make people quit trying to integrate the South .
 86: [the South] I failed to see how taking positions like that in the North would help them defend those things in the South .
197: [South] I suppose somewhere along that time , I think it was May of ' 71 , four or five months after I took office Sheriff Amerson , who was the first elected black sheriff in modern times in the South , had been indicted by the federal government .
197: [the South] I suppose somewhere along that time , I think it was May of ' 71 , four or five months after I took office Sheriff Amerson , who was the first elected black sheriff in modern times in the South , had been indicted by the federal government .

217: [his] The first suspects in the Sixteenth Street Church bombing were J. B. Stoner and his group .
221: [Stoner] As we developed the case we had a guy in Georgia who kept wanting to give us information on a Klansman and wanting to be paid , and he said Stoner had done the bombings .
222: [Stoner] So Stoner was our first suspect , and we proceeded after him , looking at him , and that trailed on for quite a while , and finally concluded that although Stoner had done a lot of other bombings he did n't do this one .
222: [he] So Stoner was our first suspect , and we proceeded after him , looking at him , and that trailed on for quite a while , and finally concluded that although Stoner had done a lot of other bombings he did n't do this one .

223: [He] He did n't do the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church , but he had done a lot of others .

226: [he] We found several cases where we felt like we did have Stoner and he had bombed them , but most of them the statute of limitations has run out .
230: [Stoner] But since Stoner , thank goodness , his bombings did n't result in any deaths it did n't look like we could do anything on any of his bombings .
230: [his] But since Stoner , thank goodness , his bombings did n't result in any deaths it did n't look like we could do anything on any of his bombings .
231: [he] We think he was the one that left bombs at the synagogues here and some of the city council people 's houses .
232: [he] So we had to just put it on the back burner , and we were continuing to really go after the one where the deaths , the little girls were killed , Sixteenth Street , and it just became obvious , like I said , he did a lot of others but not that one .
236: [Stoner] Sometime around that same time , or well not the same time , after we decided Stoner was n't the one , we got a tip that the Klan in Montgomery had come up to Birmingham and done the Sixteenth Street bombing , so we went back and started working that .
386: [J. B. Stone] I mentioned J. B. Stone had been our first suspect and done a lot of bombings , but just not the Sixteenth Street Church bombing , and that the statute of limitations had run .
386: [our first suspect] I mentioned J. B. Stone had been our first suspect and done a lot of bombings , but just not the Sixteenth Street Church bombing , and that the statute of limitations had run .
394: [Stoner] So what we indicted Chambliss for -- I 'm sorry -- what we indicted Stoner for -- we could prove that case -- was not setting off the bomb at the church because the statute of limitations had run on that .
399: [Stoner] That 's the way we got around the statue of limitations on Stoner .
458: [their suspects] But I ca n't take their side in not later sharing that with me where I could have a chance , or we could have a chance , to bring the people that they knew were guilty , and they knew were their suspects , to help us prosecute it , especially to act like and make us think that they were helping .

"Mrs. Chambliss"
Chambliss [PERSON]
228: [Chambliss] That 's why we could get Chambliss , and why even recently in the last couple of years they could go back and get Blanton and Cherry because on a murder , not just a civil rights murder , any murder , in state court in Alabama there is no statute of limitations , and I think that 's as it should be .
249: [Chambliss] Eventually , though , the roads led to Chambliss and his group , Blanton and Cherry , and their group as we started working on that .
249: [his] Eventually , though , the roads led to Chambliss and his group , Blanton and Cherry , and their group as we started working on that .
263: [Chambliss] We kept trying to do our investigation as best we could , and that led us more and more on our own merits to Chambliss and his group , Blanton and Cherry , and the others , and we worked quite a bit .
263: [his] We kept trying to do our investigation as best we could , and that led us more and more on our own merits to Chambliss and his group , Blanton and Cherry , and the others , and we worked quite a bit .
342: [Chambliss] It turns out I think we could have convicted Blanton for sure back when we convicted Chambliss and maybe Cherry also , although Cherry would be a little bit more iffy because a lot of stuff that they convicted Cherry on came out of his own mouth after the fact , bragging about what he had done .
344: [Chambliss] But Blanton I think for sure we could have convicted back when we did Chambliss .
356: [Chambliss] We had a positive ID of Chambliss , and a positive ID of Blanton 's car , but not a positive ID of Blanton .
358: [Chambliss] In fact our suspects were Blanton , Cherry , and Chambliss , and then some other people that helped .
369: [Chambliss] We ended up deciding just to indict Chambliss .
372: [Chambliss] Our evidence on Chambliss was stronger than on the others , and Chambliss also was the ring leader .
372: [the ring leader] Our evidence on Chambliss was stronger than on the others , and Chambliss also was the ring leader .
373: [He] He was the one that really made it happen .
376: [Chambliss] So we felt like not only getting the ring leader , but if we got him , he was the one they thought was the toughest and it might be easier to come back and get some of the others , people to talk on the others , if we got Chambliss .
376: [he] So we felt like not only getting the ring leader , but if we got him , he was the one they thought was the toughest and it might be easier to come back and get some of the others , people to talk on the others , if we got Chambliss .
376: [him] So we felt like not only getting the ring leader , but if we got him , he was the one they thought was the toughest and it might be easier to come back and get some of the others , people to talk on the others , if we got Chambliss .
376: [the ring leader] So we felt like not only getting the ring leader , but if we got him , he was the one they thought was the toughest and it might be easier to come back and get some of the others , people to talk on the others , if we got Chambliss .
377: [Chambliss] Then the bad side was , since we had a stronger case against Chambliss , if we went ahead and indicted all of them Chambliss was older and not in that good of health .
381: [Chambliss '] And claim that Chambliss ' health prevented him from going on trial , and make us go to trial with one of the ones that we did n't have as good of evidence on .
381: [him] And claim that Chambliss ' health prevented him from going on trial , and make us go to trial with one of the ones that we did n't have as good of evidence on .
384: [Chambliss] So I said , `` We 'll just go with Chambliss and then come back and try to get the others . ''
394: [Chambliss] So what we indicted Chambliss for -- I 'm sorry -- what we indicted Stoner for -- we could prove that case -- was not setting off the bomb at the church because the statute of limitations had run on that .
397: [him] We could n't prosecute it , so we indicted him for setting off explosives dangerously near an occupied dwelling house .
398: [He] He technically was convicted -- not technically -- he was convicted , not of bombing the church , but of setting it off close to those houses that were right up there next to the church .
398: [he] He technically was convicted -- not technically -- he was convicted , not of bombing the church , but of setting it off close to those houses that were right up there next to the church .
401: [Chambliss] I do n't know how much you want to get into the trial of Chambliss .
403: [His] His lawyers were Art Hanes and his son Art Junior .
409: [Chambliss] Thank goodness they did the right thing and found Chambliss guilty .
412: [Chambliss] Chambliss was the main ring leader of that bombing that took those little innocent children 's lives , and as well injured Birmingham and Alabama in a way that we 're still recovering from .
412: [the main ring leader of that bombing that took those little innocent children 's lives , and as well injured Birmingham and Alabama in a way that we 're still recovering from] Chambliss was the main ring leader of that bombing that took those little innocent children 's lives , and as well injured Birmingham and Alabama in a way that we 're still recovering from .
413: [Chambliss] Of course , we were doing a lot of other injuries to ourselves back in those days then without that , but I 'm just glad I was able to be a part of finally bringing that first part of it to trial , and I 'm glad that somebody like Doug Jones -- Doug Jones was a young law student at the time of the Chambliss trial .
451: [Chambliss] They had more evidence than what I had to convict Chambliss , but , and this is a big but -- I mentioned early on when I was talking about Jack Shaws , my chief investigator , saw Martin Luther King 's house and church bombing in Montgomery and got confessions , and juries turned them loose even with confessions .
475: [Chambliss] Well , there were three or four in Chambliss .
479: [Chambliss] The next day she told the FBI and the Birmingham Police , told them what she had seen , picked out the car and when they showed her a bunch of pictures she picked Chambliss out .
480: [he] She said the dome light -- he was the only one she could identify .
481: [Chambliss] She identified the car , Blanton 's to a T , and Chambliss , picked him out to a T .
527: [Chambliss '] The best witness though was Chambliss ' niece , Elizabeth Cobbs .
535: [Chambliss] Chambliss did n't ever know .
536: [Chambliss '] Chambliss ' wife and her sister who 's Elizabeth Cobbs aunt , and Elizabeth Cobbs had been giving information to the FBI all during the years .
537: [Chambliss '] Chambliss ' wife had been passing it on .
543: [Chambliss '] It turns out that they had hidden microphones in Chambliss ' house for the FBI and other things .
546: [Chambliss] You could look over at Chambliss and you could tell .
547: [He] He was looking with hatred .
549: [He] He looked like he 'd been hit with a severe blow when she walked in that courtroom .
549: [he] He looked like he 'd been hit with a severe blow when she walked in that courtroom .
555: [Chambliss '] But she and her aunt did what was right at the time of the bombings , and did what was right at the time of the trial , and Chambliss ' wife did too .
563: [Chambliss] Art Junior told me that after the guilty verdict came down , of course they carried Chambliss away in handcuffs .
565: [Mrs. Chambliss] So Art said that his dad assigned him the job of going to tell Mrs. Chambliss .
570: [Mrs. Chambliss] Can I come in Mrs. Chambliss ? '' She says , `` Yes , come in . ''
573: [Chambliss] He said , `` Mrs. Chambliss , I 'm sorry to tell you that I 've got to come tell you that the jury found Bob guilty , '' or Robert guilty .
573: [Mrs. Chambliss] He said , `` Mrs. Chambliss , I 'm sorry to tell you that I 've got to come tell you that the jury found Bob guilty , '' or Robert guilty .
578: [Mrs. Chambliss] She said , `` Well , when will he be coming home ? '' He said , `` I 'm afraid he wo n't be Mrs. Chambliss .
585: [Mrs. Chambliss] She said , `` You sure he 's not going to come home ? '' He said , `` I 'm afraid so Mrs. Chambliss . ''

"Blanton 's"
Blanton [PERSON]
228: [Blanton] That 's why we could get Chambliss , and why even recently in the last couple of years they could go back and get Blanton and Cherry because on a murder , not just a civil rights murder , any murder , in state court in Alabama there is no statute of limitations , and I think that 's as it should be .
249: [Blanton] Eventually , though , the roads led to Chambliss and his group , Blanton and Cherry , and their group as we started working on that .
263: [Blanton] We kept trying to do our investigation as best we could , and that led us more and more on our own merits to Chambliss and his group , Blanton and Cherry , and the others , and we worked quite a bit .
336: [Blanton] Of course it turns out , and I only learned this the last couple of years when they tried Blanton and Cherry , that the FBI in spite of telling us they were cooperating still held out on us and did n't give us everything .
344: [Blanton] But Blanton I think for sure we could have convicted back when we did Chambliss .
345: [him] So you did n't have access to any of the tapes that they used or did n't know anything about him ?
356: [Blanton] We had a positive ID of Chambliss , and a positive ID of Blanton 's car , but not a positive ID of Blanton .
356: [Blanton 's] We had a positive ID of Chambliss , and a positive ID of Blanton 's car , but not a positive ID of Blanton .
358: [Blanton] In fact our suspects were Blanton , Cherry , and Chambliss , and then some other people that helped .
416: [Blanton] That somehow inspired him where years later when Doug was U. S. Attorney he reopened the case and came back and got Blanton and then Cherry .
470: [Blanton] So it was n't any iron clad cinch we could get a conviction , and it certainly was n't for Doug Jones either in his two recent prosecutions of Blanton and Cherry .
559: [Blanton] Apparently a lot of these Klansmen were also , Cherry particularly , I think Blanton also , but I know Cherry was , were abusers .

"Cherry"
Cherry [PERSON]

372: [the others] Our evidence on Chambliss was stronger than on the others , and Chambliss also was the ring leader .
376: [the others] So we felt like not only getting the ring leader , but if we got him , he was the one they thought was the toughest and it might be easier to come back and get some of the others , people to talk on the others , if we got Chambliss .
376: [the others , people] So we felt like not only getting the ring leader , but if we got him , he was the one they thought was the toughest and it might be easier to come back and get some of the others , people to talk on the others , if we got Chambliss .
384: [the others] So I said , `` We 'll just go with Chambliss and then come back and try to get the others . ''
